- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @oljer
- ðŸ‘€ I need some help with Lasergrbl. I didn't use my Yora 6550 for a couple of months
and I updated my computer from Windows 10 to Windows 11 plus I installed an up date Lasergrbl v 4.6.2
now when I click the right or left arrows the head does NOT move and when I click the up arrow the head moves up/right 
@ 45 degrees. When I click the down arrow the head moves down/left @ 45 degrees.
There must be a software fix that I don't know about. Does anyone know how to correct my problem?
